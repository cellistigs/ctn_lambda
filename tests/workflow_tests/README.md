This folder contains tests for the github actions workflows actions we would like to run. These will depend on the tools *act*, (found _`here <https://github.com/nektos/act#runners>`_ that runs github actions events locally inside docker containers). This is kind of a pain to set up (lots of big containers to download, coordinating the runner), but I have faith it will be faster in the long run than testing remotely each time. We also have test materials consisting of the event payloads that github uses to trigger its actions. These are printed directly from real events (job "Print event" in the test_pr_deploy workflow generates these).
