Some documentation for the costs associated with this experiment. 

The support costs for all local pricing (Orig,PowerMatch,Local) were based on the desktop support costs as given in morey & nambiar, which aggregates patterns of pc lifecycle and support costs over a broad range of industries. The support costs are aggregates across these industries. They are as follows: [433,465,499,539+26,585+59], where the additional costs in the last two years represent out of warranty repair costs. The final comparison given in the paper is the "Powermatch" comparison, which is a desktop that can be found here: https://www.newegg.com/p/1VK-001E-1SVY3?Item=9SIADB38AG7178&Description=1080%20ti%20workstation%2064%20gB%204%20core&cm_re=1080_ti_workstation_64_gB_4_core-_-1VK-001E-1SVY3-_-Product 

Orig: the original benchmarking price used to determine feasibility (Summer 2019)
Local: the revised benchmarking price used to make initial version of figures with architecture approximately matched. (February 2020)
Cluster: AWS TCO calculator cost (February 2020)
Hard: Considering "Local" cost without support for an even more barebones comparison (February 2020)
PowerMatch: final workstation benchmarking price with processor power approximately matched. (May 2020)

The cluster costs are given by the AWS TCO calculator. We aggregated the following costs: Total server hardware cost (undiscounted): 1701, acquisition cost of NAS storage: 400, price tag cost of GPU if applicable (the AWS TCO calculator does not provide this number): 1555. We added in the following support costs: storage administration cost (2), server hardware maintenance cost (255), and IT Labor (135) costs as constant yearly recurring costs.
